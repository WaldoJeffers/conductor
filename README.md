**conductor** is a modern utility library to help you control the execution flow using functional programming.

## ðŸ¤µ description

It provides a set of utility functions which can be used both with _asynchronous_ and _synchronous_ code, allowing you to control your execution flow very clearly and with a minimum of code. The library is designed in a functional programming spirit, to provide a coherent API and highly composable functions. Think of it as if [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) & [Async](http://caolan.github.io/async/) had a baby.

## ðŸ”§ installation

```text
npm install conductor
```

## âœ¨ examples

Here are a few examples of what you can do with **conductor**.

### use asynchronous functions seamlessly

```javascript
import { map } from 'conductor'

const fetchCharacter = id => fetch(`https://swapi.co/api/people/${id}`).then(res => res.json())
const character_ids = [1, 2, 3]
await map(fetchCharacter, character_ids) // [{id: 1, name: 'Luke'}, ...]
```

You can use `map` with an asynchronous mapper and directly use the `await` keyword. No need to use `Promise.all` like you need to with `Array.prototype.map` or `lodash.map`.

### compose things

```javascript
import { compose, get } from 'conductor'

const character_id = 1
const fetchCharacter = id => fetch(`https://swapi.co/api/people/${id}`).then(res => res.json())
const fetchPlanet = url => fetch(url).then(res => res.json())
const getHomeworldName = compose(get('name'), fetchPlanet, get('homeworld'), fetchCharacter)

await getHomeworldName(character_id) // Tatooine
```

You can **compose** functions seamlessly, without ever wondering if you need to use `Promise.prototype.then` because one function returns a `Promise`. Simply add `await` before compose if one your functions is asynchronous.

### functional by design

```javascript
import { compose, equals, get, join, map, filter } from 'conductor'

const jedis = [
  { name: 'Luke', side: 'light' },
  { name: 'Yoda', side: 'light' },
  { name: 'Darth Vader', side: 'dark' },
]
const isGood = filter(compose(equals('light'), get('side')))
const getName = map(get('name'))
const concat = join(', ')

compose(concat, getName, isGood)(jedis) // 'Luke, Yoda'
```

All functions in **conductor** are **curried** by default, which means they can be used in a partially applied form to define very modular and composable blocks in your code. In the example above, we have an array of `jedis`, and we want to retrieve a concatenated string of all the good guys' name. We first define an `isGood` function, which will filter out the bad guys. Then, we create a mapping function`getName`which will retrieve each jedi's name. Finally, we create a concatenating function called `concat`. We can now easily compose them and pass the`jedis` array to the resulting function. Notice how we created small & modular **point-free** functions, and only passed the input data when we actually needed to.
